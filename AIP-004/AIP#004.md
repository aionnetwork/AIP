## Summary

A fungible token standard to meet the functionality requirements of current dApp developers and enable cross-chain token movements.

## Value Proposition

To enable the creation and management of innovative fungible cross-chain digital assets on the Aion blockchain and other connected networks.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for the proposal is to provide the dApp's that are building on the Aion blockchain with a common standard to implement fungible tokens while enabling cross-chain functionality for their asset with minimal effort. The secondary motivation is to define the required contract interfaces and events to communicate with bridges and identify any upgrade requirements for current token standards on remote blockchains to allow communication with bridges.

## Non-Goals

The scope of this standard is limited to on-chain functionality for fungible tokens. This standard does not address how cross-chain token movements should be reflected on third party services or tools such as blockchain explorers, wallets or exchanges.

## Success Metrics

There are two key indicators of success for this standard:
1) Number of contract deployments
2) Number of deployed contracts with defined operators for cross-chain movements

## Description

Fungible tokens have proven to be one of the core building blocks of the current decentralized web era. This next-generation fungible token standard reflects the evolving needs of dApp developers for core functionality and security.

The Aion Fungible Token Standard has been designed to address the shortcomings of token standards on other existing blockchains by blurring the line between layer one and layer two. At the core of the design is the ability to perform cross chain token transfers while maintaining security and stable total supply. Additional features include safe transfers, token callbacks, and mint/burn interface.

This standard aims to provide a reliable interface which 3rd party tools can use when building products on top of Aion.

### High-Level Architecture
This diagram provides a high-level overview of the proposed contract architecture related to fungible tokens to enable cross-chain movements and communicate with bridges.

Note: The scope of this AIP is limited to the ATS contract highlighted. In the diagram below the Aion blockchain is the Home chain.

## Specification

### Definitions

- Bridge Operator: A organization(s) / project (s) / account that execute the required functions to enable a cross-chain transaction on behalf of the token holder
- Bridge Registry: A smart contract registry that maintains a mapping of `bridgeId`, Bridge Contracts and `networkId`
- Bridge Contract: A smart contract designed to receive, verify and emit events and signature bundles from/to a specific bridge
- Token Issuer: The project / user / account that owns the Token Contract
- Token Contract: A smart contract that is deployed using this token standard
- Token Holder: An account / user that has ownership over a token balance
- Token Sender: An account / user that is sending a token
- Token Receiver: An account / user that is receiving a token
- Home chain: The blockchain network where the cross-chain transaction originates and is emitted from
- Remote chain: The blockchain network that is the destination for the cross-chain transaction

### Methods

#### **General**

The `constant` functions detailed below MUST be implemented.

**`name` function**

Returns the name of the token, e.g., `"MyToken"`.

> **returns:** Name of the token.

``` solidity
 function name() public constant returns (string)
```

**`symbol` function**

Returns the symbol of the token, e.g., `"MYT"`.

> **returns:** Symbol of the token.

``` solidity
function symbol() public constant returns (string)
```

**`totalSupply` function**

Get the total number of minted tokens across all chains.

> **returns:** Total supply of tokens currently in circulation.

``` solidity
function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint128)
```

**`balanceOf` function**

Get the balance of the account with address `tokenHolder` on Home chain.

*NOTE*: `balanceOf(address(this))` is the frozen token supply and MUST be equal to `totalSupply` minus `liquidSupply`.

*NOTE*: The balance MUST be zero (`0`) or higher.

> **parameters**  
> `tokenHolder`: Address for which the balance is returned.
>
> **returns:** Amount of token held by `tokenHolder` in the token contract.

``` solidity
function balanceOf(address tokenHolder) public constant returns (uint128)
```

**`granularity` function**

Get the smallest part of the token that's not divisible.

In other words, the granularity is the smallest number of tokens (in the basic unit) which MAY be minted, sent, burned, frozen, or thawed in any transaction.

The following rules MUST be applied regarding the *granularity*:

- The *granularity* value MUST be set at creation time.
- The *granularity* value MUST be the same across all chains.
- The *granularity* value MUST NOT be changed ever.
- The *granularity* value MUST be greater or equal to `1`.
- Any minting, send, burning, freezing, or thawing of tokens MUST be a multiple of the *granularity* value.
- Any operation that would result in a balance that's not a multiple of the *granularity* value MUST be considered invalid, and the transaction MUST `revert`.

*NOTE*: Most of the tokens SHOULD have a granularity of `1` unless there is a good reason for not allowing divisibility of the token.

> **returns:** The smallest non-divisible part of the token.

``` solidity
function granularity() public constant returns (uint128)
```

#### **Operators**

An `operator` is an address which is allowed to send, burn and freeze tokens on behalf of another address.

The following rules apply to any *operator*:

- An address MUST always be an *operator* for itself. Hence an address MUST NOT ever be revoked as its own *operator*.
- If an address is an *operator* for a *token holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `true`.
- If an address is not an *operator* for a *token holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `false`.
- The token contract MUST emit an `AuthorizedOperator` event with the correct values when a *token holder* authorizes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`AuthorizedOperator` Event][authorizedoperator].
- The token contract MUST emit a `RevokedOperator` event with the correct values when a *token holder* revokes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`RevokedOperator` Event][revokedoperator].

*NOTE*: A *token holder* MAY have multiple *operators* at the same time.

*NOTE*: A *token holder* MAY authorize an already authorized *operator*. An `AuthorizedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

*NOTE*: A *token holder* MAY revoke an already revoked *operator*. A `RevokedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

**`AuthorizedOperator` event** <a id="authorizedoperator"></a>

Indicates the authorization of `operator` as an *operator* for `tokenHolder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* authorization process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which became an *operator* of `tokenHolder`.  
> `tokenHolder`: Address of a token holder which authorized the `operator` address as an *operator*.

``` solidity
event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder)
```

**`RevokedOperator` event** <a id="revokedoperator"></a>

Indicates the revocation of `operator` as an *operator* for `tokenHolder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* revocation process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which was revoked as an *operator* of `tokenHolder`.  
> `tokenHolder`: Address of a token holder which revoked the `operator` address as an *operator*.

``` solidity
event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder)
```

The `authorizeOperator`, `revokeOperator` and `isOperatorFor` functions described below MUST be implemented to manage *operators*.
Token contracts MAY implement other functions to manage *operators*.

**`authorizeOperator` function**

Set a third party `operator` address as an *operator* of `msg.sender` to send, burn or freeze tokens on its behalf.

*NOTE*: The *token holder* (`msg.sender`) is always an *operator* for itself. This right MUST NOT be revoked. This function MUST `revert` if it is called to authorize the token holder (`msg.sender`) as an *operator* for itself (i.e. if `operator` is equal to `msg.sender`).

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address to set as an *operator* for `msg.sender`.

``` solidity
function authorizeOperator(address operator) public
```

**`revokeOperator` function**

Remove the right of the `operator` address to be an *operator* for `msg.sender` and to send, burn or freeze tokens on its behalf.

*NOTE*: The *token holder* (`msg.sender`) is always an *operator* for itself. This right MUST NOT be revoked. This function MUST `revert` if it is called to revoke the token holder (`msg.sender`) as an *operator* for itself (i.e., if `operator` is equal to `msg.sender`).

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address to rescind as an *operator* for `msg.sender`.

``` solidity
function revokeOperator(address operator) public
```

**`isOperatorFor` function** <a id="isOperatorFor"></a>

Indicate whether the `operator` address is an *operator* of the `tokenHolder` address.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which may be an *operator* of `tokenHolder`.  
> `tokenHolder`: Address of a token holder which may have the `operator` address as an *operator*.
>
> **returns:** `true` if `operator` is an *operator* of `tokenHolder` and `false` otherwise.

``` solidity
function isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) public constant returns (bool)
```

#### **Cross Chain Movements**

**`liquidSupply` function** <a id="liquidSupply"></a>

Indicate the total supply of tokens currently in circulation on this chain.

*NOTE*: The liquid supply MUST be equal to `totalSupply` minus `balanceOf(address(this))`.

*NOTE*: The liquid supply MUST be equal to the sum of the balances of all addresses other than `address(this)` as returned by the `balanceOf` function.

> **returns:** Total supply of tokens currently in circulation on this chain.

``` solidity
function liquidSupply() public constant returns (uint128)
```

``` solidity
event Froze(address indexed localSender, bytes32 indexed remoteRecipient, uint128 amount, bytes32 indexed bridgeId, bytes localData)
```

#### **Sending Tokens**

When an *operator* sends an `amount` of tokens from a *token holder* to a *recipient* with the associated `data` and `operatorData`, the token contract MUST apply the following rules:

- Any *token holder* MAY send tokens to any *recipient*.
- The balance of the *token holder* MUST be decreased by the `amount`.
- The balance of the *recipient* MUST be increased by the `amount`.
- The balance of the *token holder* MUST be greater or equal to the `amount`&mdash;such that its resulting balance is greater or equal to zero (`0`) after the send.
- The token contract MUST emit a `Sent` event with the correct values as defined in the [`Sent` Event][sent].
- The *operator* MAY communicate any information in the `operatorData`.
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensToSend` hook of the *token holder* if the *token holder* registers an `ATSTokenSender` implementation via [ERC820].
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensReceived` hook of the *recipient* if the *recipient* registers an `ATSTokenRecipient` implementation via [ERC820].
- The `data` and `operatorData` MUST be immutable during the entire send process&mdash;hence the same `data` and `operatorData` MUST be used to call both hooks and emit the `Sent` event.

The token contract MUST `revert` when sending in any of the following cases:

- The *operator* address is not an authorized operator for the *token holder*.
- The resulting *token holder* balance or *recipient* balance after the send is not a multiple of the *granularity* defined by the token contract.
- The address of the *token holder* or the *recipient* is `0x0`.
- Any of the resulting balances becomes negative, i.e. becomes less than zero (`0`).

The token contract MAY send tokens from many *token holders*, to many *recipients*, or both. In this case:

- The previous send rules MUST apply to all the *token holders* and all the *recipients*.
- The sum of all the balances incremented MUST be equal to the total sent `amount`.
- The sum of all the balances decremented MUST be equal to the total sent `amount`.
- A `Sent` event MUST be emitted for every *token holder* and *recipient* pair with the corresponding amount for each pair.
- The sum of all the amounts from the `Sent` event MUST be equal to the total sent `amount`.

*NOTE*: Mechanisms such as applying a fee on a send is considered as a send to multiple *recipients*: the intended *recipient* and the fee *recipient*.

*NOTE*: Transfer of tokens MAY be chained. For example, if a contract upon receiving tokens sends them further to another address. In this case, the previous send rules apply to each send, in order.

*NOTE*: Sending an amount of zero (`0`) tokens is valid and MUST be treated as a regular send.

*Implementation Requirement*:  
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensToSend` hook *before* updating the state.
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensReceived` hook *after* updating the state.  
I.e., `tokensToSend` MUST be called first, then the balances MUST be updated to reflect the send, and finally `tokensReceived` MUST be called *afterward*. Thus a `balanceOf` call within `tokensToSend` returns the balance of the address *before* the send and a `balanceOf` call within `tokensReceived` returns the balance of the address *after* the send.

*NOTE*: The `data` field contains extra information intended for, and defined by the recipient&mdash; similar to the data field in a regular ether send transaction. Typically, `data` is used to describe the intent behind the send. The `operatorData` MUST only be provided by the *operator*. It is intended more for logging purposes and particular cases. (Examples include payment references, cheque numbers, countersignatures and more.) In most of the cases the recipient would ignore the `operatorData`, or at most, it would log the `operatorData`.

**`Sent` event** <a id="sent"></a>

Indicate a send of `amount` of tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address by the `operator` address.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of a send or an [ERC20] transfer process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which triggered the send.  
> `from`: Token holder.  
> `to`: Token recipient.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to send.  
> `data`: Information attached to the send, and intended for the recipient (`to`).  
> `operatorData`: Information attached to the send by the `operator`.

``` solidity
event Sent(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint128 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData)
```

The `send` and `operatorSend` functions described below MUST be implemented to send tokens.
Token contracts MAY implement other functions to send tokens.

*NOTE*: An address MAY send an amount of `0`, which is valid and MUST be treated as a regular send.

**`send` function** <a id="send"></a>

Send the `amount` of tokens from the address `msg.sender` to the address `to`.

The *operator* and the *token holder* MUST both be the `msg.sender`.

> **parameters**  
> `to`: Token recipient.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to send.  
> `data`: Information attached to the send, and intended for the recipient (`to`).

``` solidity
function send(address to, uint128 amount, bytes data) public
```

**`operatorSend` function** <a id="operatorSend"></a>

Send the `amount` of tokens on behalf of the address `from` to the address `to`.

The *operator* MUST be `msg.sender`. The value of `from` MAY be `0x0`, then the `from` (*token holder*) used for the send MUST be `msg.sender` (the `operator`).

*Reminder*: If the *operator* address is not an authorized operator of the `from` address, then the send process MUST `revert`.

*NOTE*: `from` and `msg.sender` MAY be the same address. I.e., an address MAY call `operatorSend` for itself. This call MUST be equivalent to `send` with the addition that the *operator* MAY specify an explicit value for `operatorData` (which cannot be done with the `send` function).

> **parameters**  
> `from`: Token holder (or `0x0` to set `from` to `msg.sender`).  
> `to`: Token recipient.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to send.  
> `data`: Information attached to the send, and intended for the recipient (`to`).  
> `operatorData`: Information attached to the send by the `operator`.

``` solidity
function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint128 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) public
```

#### **Minting Tokens**

Minting tokens is the act of producing new tokens. This standard intentionally does not define specific functions to mint tokens. This intent comes from the wish not to limit the use of the standard as the minting process is generally an implementation detail.

Nonetheless, the rules below MUST be respected when minting for a *recipient*:

- Tokens MUST be minted on all chains such that `totalSupply` remains equal on all chains.
- Tokens MUST be minted to `address(this)` when minting is initiated on other chain such that the correct `liquidSupply` is maintained.
- Tokens MAY be minted for any *recipient* address.
- The total supply MUST be increased by the amount of tokens minted.
- The balance of `0x0` MUST NOT be decreased.
- The balance of the *recipient* MUST be increased by the amount of tokens minted.
- The token contract MUST emit a `Minted` event with the correct values as defined in the [`Minted` Event][minted].
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensReceived` hook of the *recipient* if the *recipient* registers an `ATSTokenRecipient` implementation via [ERC820].
- The `data` and `operatorData` MUST be immutable during the entire mint process&mdash;hence the same `data` and `operatorData` MUST be used to call the `tokensReceived` hook and emit the `Minted` event.

The token contract MUST `revert` when minting in any of the following cases:

- The resulting *recipient* balance after the mint is not a multiple of the *granularity* defined by the token contract.
- The *recipient* is a contract, and it does not implement the `ATSTokenRecipient` interface via [ERC820].
- The address of the *recipient* is `0x0`.

*NOTE*: The initial token supply at the creation of the token contract MUST be considered as minting for the amount of the initial supply to the address (or addresses) receiving the initial supply.

The token contract MAY mint tokens for multiple *recipients* at once. In this case:

- The previous mint rules MUST apply to all the *recipients*.
- The sum of all the balances incremented MUST be equal to the total minted amount.
- A `Minted` event MUST be emitted for every *recipient* with the corresponding amount for each *recipient*.
- The sum of all the amounts from the `Minted` event MUST be equal to the total minted `amount`.

*NOTE*: Minting an amount of zero (`0`) tokens is valid and MUST be treated as a regular mint.

*NOTE*: The `data` field contains extra information intended for, and defined by the recipient&mdash; similar to the data field in a regular ether send transaction. Typically, `data` is used to describe the intent behind the mint. The `operatorData` MUST only be provided by the *operator*. It is intended more for logging purposes and particular cases. (Examples include payment references, cheque numbers, countersignatures and more.) In most of the cases the recipient would ignore the `operatorData`, or at most, it would log the `operatorData`.

**`Minted` event** <a id="minted"></a>

Indicate the minting of `amount` of tokens to the `to` address by the `operator` address.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of a mint process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which triggered the mint.  
> `to`: Token recipient.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens minted.  
> `data`: Information attached to the minting, and intended for the recipient (`to`).  
> `operatorData`: Information attached to the minting by the `operator`.

``` solidity
event Minted(address indexed operator, address indexed to, uint128 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData)
```

#### **Burning Tokens**

Burning tokens is the act of destroying existing tokens. ATS explicitly defines two functions to burn tokens (`burn` and `operatorBurn`). These functions facilitate the integration of the burning process in wallets and dapps. However, the token contract MAY prevent some or all *token holders* from burning tokens for any reason. The token contract MAY also define other functions to burn tokens.

The rules below MUST be respected when burning the tokens of a *token holder*:

- Tokens MUST be burned on all chains such that `totalSupply` remains equal on all chains.
- Tokens MUST be burned from `address(this)` when burned is initiated on other chain such that the correct `liquidSupply` is maintained.
- Tokens MAY be burned from any *token holder* address.
- The total supply MUST be decreased by the amount of tokens burned.
- The balance of `0x0` MUST NOT be increased.
- The balance of the *token holder* MUST be decreased by amount of tokens burned.
- The token contract MUST emit a `Burned` event with the correct values as defined in the [`Burned` Event][burned].
- The token contract MUST call the `tokensToSend` hook of the *token holder* if the *token holder* registers an `ATSTokenSender` implementation via [ERC820].
- The `operatorData` MUST be immutable during the entire burn process&mdash;hence the same `operatorData` MUST be used to call the `tokensToSend` hook and emit the `Burned` event.
- The `data` field of the `tokensToSend` hook MUST be empty.

The token contract MUST `revert` when burning in any of the following cases:

- The *operator* address is not an authorized operator for the *token holder*.
- The resulting *token holder* balance after the burn is not a multiple of the *granularity* defined by the token contract.
- The balance of *token holder* is inferior to the amount of tokens to burn (i.e., resulting in a negative balance for the *token holder*).
- The address of the *token holder* is `0x0`.

The token contract MAY burn tokens for multiple *token holders* at once. In this case:

- The previous burn rules MUST apply to each *token holders*.
- The sum of all the balances decremented MUST be equal to the total burned amount.
- A `Burned` event MUST be emitted for every *token holder* with the corresponding amount for each *token holder*.
- The sum of all the amounts from the `Burned` event MUST be equal to the total burned `amount`.

*NOTE*: Burning an amount of zero (`0`) tokens is valid and MUST be treated as a regular burn.

**`Burned` event** <a id="burned"></a>

Indicate the burning of `amount` of tokens from the `from` address by the `operator` address.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of a burn process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which triggered the burn.  
> `from`: Token holder whose tokens are burned.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens burned.  
> `operatorData`: Information attached to the burn by the `operator`.

``` solidity
event Burned(address indexed operator, address indexed from, uint128 amount, bytes operatorData)
```

The `burn` and `operatorBurn` functions described below MUST be implemented to burn tokens.
Token contracts MAY implement other functions to burn tokens.

**`burn` function** <a id="burn"></a>

Burn the `amount` of tokens from the address `msg.sender`.

The *operator* and the *token holder* MUST both be the `msg.sender`.

> **parameters**  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to burn.

``` solidity
function burn(uint128 amount) public;
```

**`operatorBurn` function** <a id="operatorBurn"></a>

Burn the `amount` of tokens on behalf of the address `from`.

The *operator* MUST be `msg.sender`. The value of `from` MAY be `0x0`, then the `from` (*token holder*) used for the burn MUST be `msg.sender` (the `operator`).

*Reminder*: If the *operator* address is not an authorized operator of the `from` address, then the burn process MUST `revert`.

> **parameters**  
> `from`: Token holder whose tokens will be burned (or `0x0` to set `from` to `msg.sender`).  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to burn.  
> `operatorData`: Information attached to the burn by the *operator*.

``` solidity
function operatorBurn(address from, uint128 amount, bytes operatorData) public;
```

*NOTE*: The *operator* MAY pass any information via `operatorData`. The `operatorData` MUST only be provided by the *operator*.

*NOTE*: `from` and `msg.sender` MAY be the same address. I.e., an address MAY call `operatorBurn` for itself. This call MUST be equivalent to `burn` with the addition that the *operator* MAY specify an explicit value for `operatorData` (which cannot be done with the `burn` function).

#### **`ATSTokenSender` And The `tokensToSend` Hook**

The `tokensToSend` hook notifies of any decrement of balance (send and burn) for a given *token holder*. Any address (regular or contract) wishing to be notified of token debits from their address MAY register the address of a contract implementing the `ATSTokenSender` interface described below via [ERC820].

``` solidity
interface ATSTokenSender {
    function tokensToSend(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint128 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    ) public;
}
```

*NOTE*: A regular address MAY register a different address implementing the interface on its behalf. A contract MAY register either its address or the address of another contract but said address MUST implement the interface on its behalf.

**`tokensToSend`**

Notify a send or burn (if `to` is `0x0`) of `amount` tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address by the `operator` address.

*NOTE*: This function MUST NOT be called outside of a burn, send or [ERC20] transfer process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which triggered the balance decrease (through sending or burning).  
> `from`: *token holder*.  
> `to`: *token recipient* for a send and `0x` for a burn.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens the *token holder* balance is decreased by.  
> `data`: Extra information provided by the *token holder*.  
> `operatorData`: Extra information provided by the address which triggered the balance decrease.

``` solidity
function tokensToSend(address operator, address from, address to, uint128 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) public
```

The following rules apply when calling the `tokensToSend` hook:

- The `tokensToSend` hook MUST be called every time the balance is decremented.
- The `tokensToSend` hook MUST be called *before* the state is updated&mdash;i.e. *before* the balance is decremented.
- `operator` MUST be the address which triggered the decrease of the balance.
- `from` MUST be the address of the *token holder* whose balance is decreased.
- `to` MUST be the address of the *recipient* whose balance is increased for a send.
- `to` MUST be `0x0` for a burn.
- `amount` MUST be the number of tokens the *token holder* balance is decreased by.
- `data` MUST contain the extra information provided by the *token holder* (if any) for a send.
- `data` MUST be empty for a burn.
- `operatorData` MUST contain the extra information provided by the address which triggered the decrease of the balance (if any).
- The *token holder* MAY block a decrease of its balance by `revert`ing. (I.e., reject the withdrawal of tokens from its account.)

*NOTE*: Multiple *token holders* MAY use the same implementation of `ATSTokenSender`.

*NOTE*: An address can register at most one implementation at any given time for all tokens. Hence the `ATSTokenSender` MUST expect to be called by different token contracts. The `msg.sender` of the `tokensToSend` call is expected to be the address of the token contract.

#### **`ATSTokenRecipient` And The `tokensReceived` Hook**

The `tokensReceived` hook notifies of any increment of the balance (send and mint) for a given *recipient*. Any address (regular or contract) wishing to be notified of token credits to their address MAY register the address of a contract implementing the `ATSTokenSender` interface described below via [ERC820].

``` solidity
interface ATSTokenRecipient {
    function tokensReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint128 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    ) public;
}
```

If the *recipient* is a contract, which has not registered an `ATSTokenRecipient` implementation; the token contract:

- MUST `revert` if the `tokensReceived` hook is called from a mint or send call.
- SHOULD accept if the `tokensReceived` hook is called from an ERC20 `transfer` or `transferFrom` call.

*NOTE*: A regular address MAY register a different address&mdash;the address of a contract&mdash;implementing the interface on its behalf. A contract MUST register either its address or the address of another contract and said address MUST implement the interface on its behalf.

**`tokensReceived`**

Notify a send or mint (if `from` is `0x0`) of `amount` tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address by the `operator` address.

*NOTE*: This function MUST NOT be called outside of a mint, send or [ERC20] transfer process.

> **parameters**  
> `operator`: Address which triggered the balance increase (through sending or minting).  
> `from`: *token holder* for a send and `0x` for a mint.  
> `to`: *token recipient*.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens the *recipient* balance is increased by.  
> `data`: Extra information provided by the *token holder* for a send and nothing (empty bytes) for a mint,.  
> `operatorData`: Extra information provided by the address which triggered the balance increase.

``` solidity
function tokensReceived(address operator, address from, address to, uint128 amount, bytes data, bytes operatorData) public
```

The following rules apply when calling the `tokensToSend` hook:

- The `tokensReceived` hook MUST be called every time the balance is incremented.
- The `tokensReceived` hook MUST be called *after* the state is updated&mdash;i.e. *after* the balance is incremented.
- `operator` MUST be the address which triggered the increase of the balance.
- `from` MUST be the address of the *token holder* whose balance is decreased for a send.
- `from` MUST be `0x0` for a mint.
- `to` MUST be the address of the *recipient* whose balance is increased.
- `amount` MUST be the number of tokens the *recipient* balance is increased by.

- `operatorData` MUST contain the extra information provided by the address which triggered the increase of the balance (if any).
- The *token holder* MAY block an increase of its balance by `revert`ing. (I.e., reject the reception of tokens.)

*NOTE*: Multiple *token holders* MAY use the same implementation of `ATSTokenRecipient`.

*NOTE*: An address can register at most one implementation at any given time for all tokens. Hence the `ATSTokenRecipient` MUST expect to be called by different token contracts. The `msg.sender` of the `tokensReceived` call is expected to be the address of the token contract.

## Logic

This standard is based on [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) from Ethereum. The following modifications have been made for additional functionality.

- `defaultOperators` removed to guarantee operators are always opt-in.
- `liquidSupply()`, `thaw()`, `freeze()`, `operatorFreeze()` functions added for cross chain transfers.
- `burn()`, `operatorBurn()` functions added for applications using slashing.

### Interface Registration

[WIP: Define token registry]

### Cross Chain Functionality

[WIP: Define bridge registry interface]

Cross-chain token transfers implies the total supply of a token is potentially shared across a number of distinct blockchains. This total supply must be invariant across all chains, as such if tokens are minted or burned on one chain, the equivalent must be done on other chains. Our approach introduces a distinction between `totalSupply` and `liquidSupply` where `totalSupply` represents the sum of liquid tokens across all chains and `liquidSupply` represents the sum of liquid tokens on the home chain. As such, `totalSupply` minus `liquidSupply` is the sum of tokens which are used on other chains and therefore currently frozen on the home chain. This frozen balance is held in the ATS contract and is equal to `balanceOf(address(this))`.

To send a cross chain token transfer from the home chain to the remote chain, the sender must freeze the token on home chain and specify the remote chain and remote token receiver address using the `freeze` or `operatorFreeze` functions. The Bridge Contract then relays the transaction to the destination chain and thaws the appropriate token amount.

To send a cross chain token transfer from a remote chain to home chain, the sender must first freeze their remote tokens by sending them to the storage contract and emitting an event which specifies the destination address on the home chain and the Bridge Contract to use. The Bridge Contract then relays the transaction to the home chain and calls the `thaw` function.

*NOTE*: An ATS token contract must register an approved Bridge Contract by calling `setPermission(bytes32 bridgeId, bool status)` in the Bridge Registry. [WIP: review security implication for async permission changes between chains]

## Risks & Assumptions

This standard is natively compatible with the [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) standard from Ethereum and can be made compatible with the [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard as an implementation detail.

*[ERC20] compatibility notes*:  
The decimals of the token MUST always be `18`. For a *pure* ATS token the [ERC20] `decimal` function is OPTIONAL, and its existence MUST NOT be relied upon when interacting with the token contract. (The decimal value of `18` is implied.) For an [ERC20] compatible token, the `decimal` function is REQUIRED and MUST return `18`. (In [ERC20], the `decimals` function is OPTIONAL, but if the value of the function is not present, it is not clearly defined and may be assumed to be `0`. Hence for compatibility reasons, `decimals` MUST be implemented for [ERC20] compatible tokens.)

The `name`, `symbol`, `totalSupply`, and `balanceOf` `constant` functions MUST be backward compatible with [ERC20].

While a `Sent` event MUST NOT be emitted when minting or burning, if the token contract is [ERC20] backward compatible, a `Transfer` event with the `from` or `to` parameter set to `0x0` SHOULD be emitted. The [ERC20] standard does not define the concept of burning tokens, but this is a commonly accepted practice.

The `tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived` hook takes precedence over [ERC20] and MUST be called (if registered) when calling [ERC20]'s `transfer` and `transferFrom` event. When called from a `transfer`, `operator` MUST be the same value as the `from`. When called from a `transferFrom`, `operator` MUST be the address which issued the `transferFrom` call.
