## Summary

A standard for a universal registry smart contract where any address can register which interface it supports and delegate responsibility for its implementation. This standard follows the ERC-820 standard from Ethereum.

## Value Proposition

Provide a way to determine if a contract implements an interface of interest before executing a transaction.

## Motivation

Contract pseudo-introspection provides a standard way for the manager of a contract to describe the interface it has implemented such that it can be queried by other contracts before executing a transaction.

Delegated implementation allows a manager to define a delegated address which implements an interface on behalf of the main address.

The registry contract also provides a simple way of monitoring the deployment of contracts with an interface of interest.

## Non-Goals

## Success Metrics

There are two key indicators of success for this standard:
1) Number of interface registered
2) Number of queries for interface registrations

## Description

A standard for a universal registry smart contract where any address can register which interface it supports and delegate responsibility for its implementation. This standard follows the ERC-820 standard from Ethereum.

Contract pseudo-introspection provides a standard way for the manager of a contract to describe the interface it has implemented such that it can be queried by other contracts before executing a transaction.

Delegated implementation allows a manager to define a delegated address which implements an interface on behalf of the main address.

The registry contract also provides a simple way of monitoring the deployment of contracts with an interface of interest.

## Specification

### Definitions

- Interface: The string name which represents the set of standard function signatures supported by the Target.
- Target: The address which is claiming to support a given Interface.
- Delegate: The address which is implementing the interface on behalf of the Target.
- Manager: The address which holds the rights to modify the registration of the Target.

### Interface Naming Conventions

Each interface name must be unique. Following the guidelines used in ERC-820, interfaces for approved AIPs must use the following conventions.

MUST be named AIP###XXXXX where ### is the number of the AIP and XXXXX should be the name of the interface in CamelCase. The meaning of this interface SHOULD be defined in the specified AIP.

Examples:

`sha3("AIP4Token")`
`sha3("AIP4TokensSender")`
`sha3("AIP4TokensRecipient")`

### Methods for AIRDelegateInterface

**`isDelegateFor` function**  

Called to get whether or not this delegate contract implements the interface `interfaceHash` for the address `target`.  

*NOTE*: Although the function returns true or false, it is necessary to return `sha3("AIR_ACCEPT_MAGIC")` to avoid issues with calling fallback functions which return booleans.  
*NOTE*: This interface is only required if the `delegate` is a different address than the `manager`.  

> **parameters**
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `interfaceHash`: Sha3 hash of the interface name.  

``` solidity
function isDelegateFor(address target, bytes32 interfaceHash) external constant returns(bytes32)
```

### Methods for AionInterfaceRegistry

**`InterfaceDelegateSet` event**  

Indicate that the address `target` supports the interface `interfaceHash` through the delegate address `delegate`.

If the `target` implements the interface itself, `target` and `delegate` will be equivalent.

This event can be monitored to determine the number of contracts on the network which support a given interface.

> **parameters**  
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `interfaceHash`: Sha3 hash of the interface name.  
> `delegate`: Address implementing the interface on behalf of `target`.  

``` solidity
event InterfaceDelegateSet(address indexed target, bytes32 indexed interfaceHash, address indexed delegate)
```

**`ManagerChanged` event**  

Indicate that the address `newManager` now controls the interface registration of the address `target`.

> **parameters**  
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `newManager`: Address controlling the registration on behalf of `target`.  

``` solidity
event ManagerChanged(address indexed target, address indexed newManager)
```

**`getInterfaceDelegate` function**  

Called to get the address of the delegate implementing the `interfaceHash` on behalf of the `target`.

*NOTE*: MUST return address `0x0` if the `target` does not support the interface.

> **parameters**
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `interfaceHash`: Sha3 hash of the interface name.  

``` solidity
function getInterfaceDelegate(address target, bytes32 interfaceHash) external constant returns (address)
```

**`getManager` function**  

Called to get the address of the manager which controls the registration of the `target`.  

*NOTE*: MUST return address `target` if no manager have been set.

> **parameters**
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  

``` solidity
function getManager(address target) public constant returns(address)
```

**`interfaceHash` function**  

Called to get the sha3 hash of an interface given its name as a string `interfaceName`.  

> **parameters**
> `interfaceName`: String of the interface name.  

``` solidity
function interfaceHash(string interfaceName) public constant returns(bytes32)
```

**`setInterfaceDelegate` function**  

Called to set the address of the `delegate` which implements the interface `interfaceHash` on behalf of the `target`.  

*NOTE*: MUST remove an interface by calling with `delegate` set to address 0.  
*NOTE*: MUST call with `delegate` set as address `target` if the target contract implements the interface itself (without a delegate).  

> **parameters**
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `interfaceName`: String of the interface name.  
> `delegate`: Address implementing the interface on behalf of `target`.  

``` solidity
function setInterfaceDelegate(address target, bytes32 interfaceHash, address delegate) public
```

**`setManager` function**  

Called to set the address of the `manager` which controls the registration of the `target`.  

> **parameters**
> `target`: Address supporting an interface.  
> `manager`: Address of the manager for `target`.  

``` solidity
function setManager(address target, address manager) public
```

```

## Logic

This standard is based on [ERC-820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-820) from Ethereum. The following modifications have been made in migrating the standard.

- Removed compatibility with ERC-165 to reduce complexity and save gas.

## Risks & Assumptions

This standard does not guarantee that a given contract will behave as described by the associated interface. Since interface registration is perform on an opt-in basis by the author of the smart contract, users querying the interface registry must assume the author could register a false interface.
