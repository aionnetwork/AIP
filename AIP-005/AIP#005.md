## Summary

A standard to meet the functionality requirements of a bidirectional bridge operator to support a two way flow of tokens or assets.

## Value Proposition

To enable the movement of tokens/assets beyond the boundary of a connected blockchain to AION and similarly in the opposite direction. Most of the tokens are tied to the network they have been created in. If a similar token is available on Aion, they can be benefited from the Aion ecosystem. Moreover, there is a value proposition to create a split ICO token to receive the benefits of two different blockchain networks.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for the proposol is to enable tokens available on other blockchain networks to be able to participate and receive the benefits of Aion blockchain. The exchange route to move the tokens across the network could be expensive and a lot more complexity involved for the user. The bridge operator helps user to move their tokens to Aion with ease. Secondly the token supply can be split on two different networks to get the best out of two networks.

## Non-Goals

The scope of this standard is limited to on-chain functionality for token transfer on two different networks. This standard does not address how cross-chain token movements should be reflected on third party services or tools such as blockchain explorers, wallets or exchanges.

## Success Metrics

There are two key indicators of success for this standard:
1) Number of contract deployments with bridge functionality
2) Number of Bridge operator contracts deployed for cross-chain movements

## Description

Fungible tokens have proven to be one of the core building blocks of the current decentralized web era. Most of the tokens are tied up in the network they have been issued.

The *bridge operator* provides a core ability to perform cross chain token transfer across a different blockchain network of which ecosystem allows to reap the benefits not available on source chain. The Aion token standard or ERC-20 controller achieve this function by maintaining security and stable token supply and choosing whom to appoint as *bridge operator*.

This standard aims to provide a reliable interface that can be implemented by any token issuer if they want to act as *bridge operator* by themselves or any trusted 3rd party looking to support bridge functionalities.

### High-Level Architecture
This diagram provides a high-level overview of the proposed *bridge operator* contract architecture related to tokens to enable cross-chain movements.

Note: The scope of this AIP is limited to the *bridge operator* contract highlighted. In the diagram.

- Bridge Contract: A smart contract designed to receive, verify and emit events and signature bundles from/to a specific bridge
- Token Issuer: The project / user / account that owns the Token Contract
- Token Contract: A smart contract that is deployed using this token standard
- Token Holder: An account / user that has ownership over a token balance
- Token Sender: An account / user that is sending a token
- Token Receiver: An account / user that is receiving a token
- source chain: The blockchain network where the cross-chain transaction originates and is emitted from
- destination chain: The blockchain network that is the destination for the cross-chain transaction

    function isValid(address bridgeOperator) constant returns (bool);

    event AddedBridgeOperator(address bridgeOperator);
    event RemovedBridgeOperator(address bridgeOperator);
}
```

#### **Bridge Operator**

A `bridge operator` is an address which is allowed to thaw tokens on destination network when an independent list of signatories confirm that the token holder has *frozen* his/her token on the source network.

The following rules apply to any *bridge operator*:

- The token contract configures an address of *bridge opeartor* to provide cross chain token movement.
- The token contract disables freeze functionality when bridge operator is not configured.
- If a failure happens while processing a bundle, the *bridge operator* marks the failure for all transfers and they MUST be *reverted*
- The token contract MUST emit a `Froze` event with the correct values when a token contract successfully executes *freeze*  [`Froze` Event].
- The bridge operator contract MUST emit a `Distributed` event with the correct values when a token contract is successfully able to execute *thaw*  [`Thaw` Event].
- The bridge operator contract MUST emit a `ProcessedBundle` event with the correct values when a *bridge operator* makes the token contract to *thaw* for all transfer transactions as defined in the [`ProcessedBundle` Event].

*NOTE*: A *token contract* MAY have multiple *bridge operators* at the same time.

#### **Bridge Operator Standard Interface**

**`initializeSignatories` function**

The *bridge operator* selects the number of independent signatories to initialize the bridge. Only the owner of the Bridge Operator contract i.e. *bridge operator* can initialize the signatories.

*NOTE*: `initializeSignatories(address[])` should be accessed when a bridge operator contract does not have any signatories assigned, otherwise fails.

> **parameters**  
> `_signatories`: List of signatory addresses.

The following rules MUST be applied for *initializeSignatories*:

- The list of *signatories* values MUST be unique at creation time.
- The *signatories* cannot be reinitialized if there exists a signatory

``` solidity
    function initializeSignatories(address[] _signatories) public onlyOwner;
```

**`addSignatory` function**

The *bridge operator* can add additional signatory after initializing the bridge. Only the owner of the Bridge Operator contract i.e. *bridge operator* can add the signatory.

> **parameters**  
> `_signatory`: signatory address.

The following rules MUST be applied for *addSignatory*:

- The *signatory* value MUST be unique.
- If previously added *signatory* exists *revert*
- If *signatory* is added successfully, emit an event *AddedSignatory*

``` solidity
    function addSignatory(address _signatory) public onlyOwner;
```

**`removeSignatory` function**

The *bridge operator* can remove existing signatories in case if they do not want to participate in process or cannot be trusted further. Only the owner of the Bridge Operator contract i.e. *bridge operator* can remove the signatory.

> **parameters**  
> `_signatory`: signatory address.

The following rules MUST be applied for *removeSignatory*:

- The *signatory* value MUST exists.
- If *signatory* exists, it is removed
- If *signatory* is removed successfully, emit an event *RemovedSignatory*

``` solidity
    function removeSignatory(address _signatory) public onlyOwner;
```

**`isValidSignatory` function**

Returns true/false if the signatory's address is selected by this bridge operator.

> **returns:** boolean.

``` solidity
    function isValidSignatory(address _signatory) constant returns (bool);
```

**`validSignatoriesCount` function**

Returns the number of selected signatories participating in the bridge operation.

> **returns:** number.

``` solidity
    function validSignatoriesCount() constant returns (uint128);
```

**`minimumSignatoriesApproval` function**

Returns the minimum number of selected signatories required to thaw tokens on the destination network.

> **returns:** number.

``` solidity
    function minimumSignatoriesApproval() constant returns (uint128);
```

**`processBundle` function**

`Bridge operator` verifies that the required minimum signatories have confirmed the bundle containing all token transfer transactions. The function iterates over all the signature parameters and decides whether to thaw from the token contract emitting `Distributed` event. If the bundle is successfully verified, it emits `ProcessedBundle` event with its correct parameters. If a bundle has already been previously verified and exists then it emits `SuccessfulTransactionHash` event with its correct parameter.

*NOTE*: These events MUST NOT be emitted elsewhere in the process.

> **parameters**  
> `_sourceBlockHash`: The block hash from the source chain having transfer transactions.   
> `_sourceTransactionHashes`: The transfer transaction hashes in the `sourceBlockHash` from the source chain.   
> `_recipients` : The destination chain account addresses participating in transfer process.   
> `_amounts` : The respective amounts to be thawed by *bridge operator*.  
> `r` : The *r* component of a signature of Secp256k1.  
> `s` : The *s* component of a signature of Secp256k1.  
> `v` : The *v* component of a signature of Secp256k1.   
> `_publicKeys` : The public keys of signatories.  
> `_signaturePart1` : The first 32 bytes of a signature of ED25519.  
> `_signaturePart2` : The last 32 bytes of a signature of ED25519.   
> `_initTransferHashes` : keccak256 hashes of respective transfer recipients, amounts, UUIDs.   

``` solidity
// processBundle function for Aion - Bridge Operator contract 
function processBundle(
        bytes32 _sourceBlockHash,
        bytes32[] _sourceTransactionHashes, 
        address[] _recipients, 
        uint128[] _amounts,
        bytes32[] _publicKeys, 
        bytes32[] _signaturePart1, 
        bytes32[] _signaturePart2, 
        bytes32[] _initTransferHashes
    ) 
        public onlyOwner;

// processBundle function for Ethereum - Bridge Operator contract 
function processBundle(
        bytes32 sourceBlockHash,
        bytes32[] sourceTransactionHashes,
        address[] recipients,
        bytes32[] amounts,
        bytes32[] r,
        bytes32[] s,
        bytes32[] v,
        bytes32[] _initTransferHashes
    ) 
        public onlyOwner;
```

**`getBundle` function**

In the case of Aion, given the hash of a bundle, retrieves the transaction hash on destination network. In the case of Ethereum, it is ignored as it does not support to access transaction hash of the executing smart contract function.

> **parameters**  
> `_bundleHash`: The hash of the bundle.
>
> **returns:** `transactionHash` if a bundle has already been processed.

``` solidity
function getBundle(bytes32 _bundleHash) constant returns (bytes32);
```

**`setBundle` function**

Set a destination chain transaction hash if the bundle is successfully processed. In the case of Aion, this method is ignored for now as the transaction hash is set in the `processBundle` function whereas in case of Ethereum it is set to 1.

*NOTE*: The *bridge operator* only should be able to set the transaction hash.

> **parameters**  
> `_bundleHash`: The hash of the bundle.  
> `_transactonHash` : The transaction hash of the `processedBundle` operation  

``` solidity
function setBundle(bytes32 _bundleHash, bytes32 _transactonHash) public onlyOwner;
```

**`Distributed` event** <a id="processBundle"></a>

Indicate a distribution of `amount` of tokens to `recipient` address on destination chain.

> **parameters**  
> `sourceTransactionHash`: Transaction hash on source chain.  
> `recipient`: Address of token recipient on destination chain.  
> `amount`: Number of tokens to thaw.  
> `initTransferHash` : keccak256 hash of respective transfer recipient, amount, UUID.   

``` solidity

// for Aion
event Distributed(
    bytes32 sourceTransactionHash, 
    address recipient, 
    uint128 amount, 
    bytes32 initTransferHash
);

// for Ethereum
event Distributed(
    bytes32 sourceTransactionHash, 
    address recipient, 
    uint256 amount, 
    bytes32 initTransferHash
);
```

**`ProcessedBundle` event** <a id="processBundle"></a>

This event is emitted at the end of processing the bundle without any errors.

*NOTE*: MUST emit `ProcessedBundle` event.

> **parameters**  
> `sourceBlockHash`: The block hash of the source chain.  
> `bundleHash`: The bundle hash of the current transfer.

``` solidity
event ProcessedBundle(bytes32 sourceBlockHash, bytes32 bundleHash);
```

**`SuccessfulTransactionHash` event** <a id="processBundle"></a>

This event informs that the bundle has already been processsed.

> **parameters**
> `destinationTransactionHash`: The transaction hash on the destination chain thawing token to recipients.  

``` solidity
event SuccessfulTransactionHash(bytes32 destinationTransactionHash);
```

## Logic


### Cross Chain Functionality

To send a cross chain token transfer from the source chain to the destination chain, the token holder must freeze the token(s) on the source chain using the `freeze` function, emitting an event which specifies the token receiver address on the destination chain. The Bridge Operator Contract then relays the transaction to the destination chain using the `thaw` function, thawing the appropriate token amount to the token receiver address on the destination chain.


## Risks & Assumptions

*[ERC20] compatibility notes*:  
This standard assumes that the token contract has cross chain functions available in ATS. In case of existing ERC20 tokens without these functions, a controller contract must be created which adds cross chain functions.
